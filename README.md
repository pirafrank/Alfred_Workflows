# Alfred workflows

## About the project

I use a lot editors, keyboard and terminal. Alfred is a great tool that lets you achieve some tasks without stop typing.

But I found some tasks to be missing on Alfred so I decided to write the plug-ins on my own. I hope to help you burst your productivity away from the mouse.

#### Side notes

* Some workflows here were previously part of another repo of mine, [OSX_utils](https://github.com/pirafrank/OSX_utils). You may want to check it out.
* Due to the increasing importance of Alfred workflows, I thought it was reasonable to move them to a dedicated repo.

## Requirements

Please note these are just plugins. You'll need **Alfred 2.6+** and its Powerpack to use them.
You can get both [here](http://www.alfredapp.com).

Unfortunately, Alfred only runs on OS X (Snow Leopard and above). I wish there'd be something like it on Linux.

## How to get it

1. Go to `dist` folder
2. Choose the workflow you want to Download
3. Download it using the `Raw` button in the right side of the GitHub toolbar.

## Installation

1. Just double click it! (Alfred require, ofc)

## Get themes, too!

I've made some themes for the Alfred UI. You can download them from [here](https://fpira.com/alfred-for-mac/).

## Contribuiting

Everyone needs help. If you feel like you want to contribute to this project send me a pull request. I can't wait to see what you'll push!

The only requirement is to propose **useful** workflows. We all seek productivity, we achive it with quality tools.

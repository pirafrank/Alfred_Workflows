# Alfred workflows

## About the project

I use a lot editors, keyboard and terminal. Alfred is a great tool that lets you achieve some tasks without stop typing.

But I found some tasks to be missing on Alfred so I decided to write the plug-ins on my own. I hope to help you burst your productivity away from the mouse.

#### Side notes

* Some workflows here were previously part of another repo of mine, [OSX_utils](https://github.com/pirafrank/OSX_utils). You may want to check it out.
* Due to the increasing importance of Alfred workflows, I thought it was reasonable to move them to a dedicated repo.

## :package: Now available on Packal ! :package:

Visit [my profile there](http://www.packal.org/users/pirafrank) for a full list of worfflows and themes.

## Requirements

Please note these are just plugins. You'll need **Alfred 2.6+** and its Powerpack to use them.
You can get both [here](http://www.alfredapp.com).

Unfortunately, Alfred only runs on OS X (Snow Leopard and above). I wish there'd be something like it on Linux.

**Please, check the packal.org page of your workflow of choice for further information.**
